# Introduction to (Java) Programming

Hello! This guide aims to teach you some of the fundamentals of programming, specifically for Java programming, with the goal that soon you will be able to help program robots, vision tracking and other fun and exciting things.

*Note: Sylabus for guide based roughly on the "Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python" [MIT edX course.](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-mitx-6-00-1x-10) [Sylabus for MIT edX course.](https://d37djvu3ytnwxt.cloudfront.net/assets/courseware/v1/8f4b7397e0cb43c31f7b45e985f978e6/asset-v1:MITx+6.00.1x_11+1T2017+type@asset+block/6001x_syllabus.pdf)
