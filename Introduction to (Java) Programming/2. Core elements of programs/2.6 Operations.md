# Core elements of programs - Operations

## Introduction

Computers can do math. But how can you get them to do Math *for you*?

It's not really that hard at all. When executing a line, if it's got Maths or something in it, it will simply evaluate it according to BODMAS.

It'll probably be clearer with an example:

```Java
System.out.println(2*(5+(3/2));
```

Will give 13.

You can also do this with variables - 

```Java
int bestestNumber = 8;
int worstestNumber = 3;
System.out.println((bestestNumber%worstestNumber)*3);
```

> Remember from Variables that % is the modulus operator - it is just the remainder. e.g. 9%4=1 as 9/4 gives a remainder of 1

The computer would see this as (8%3)*3 = (2)*3 = 6.

There's not really much else to say.
Bit of a short lesson really. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯.
