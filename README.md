# Introduction to (Java) Programming

Hello! This guide aims to teach you some of the fundamentals of programming, specifically for Java programming, with the goal that soon you will be able to help program robots, vision tracking and other fun and exciting things. There is also a series of workshops on coding in ftc.
## Java Workshops:
There are two different courses for you to chose from. One is more recent and is Java Workshops and the other one is in Java Workshops 2017. They are quite similar except that the last slide on each has different content and as such the authors of this guide recommend you read both of these slides.

*Note: Sylabus for guide based roughly on the "Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python" [MIT edX course.](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-mitx-6-00-1x-10) [Sylabus for MIT edX course.](https://d37djvu3ytnwxt.cloudfront.net/assets/courseware/v1/8f4b7397e0cb43c31f7b45e985f978e6/asset-v1:MITx+6.00.1x_11+1T2017+type@asset+block/6001x_syllabus.pdf)
